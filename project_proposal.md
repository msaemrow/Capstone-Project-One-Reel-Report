| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Tech Stack |   This project will use Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, Jinja, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS |


| Type       | This will be a website |

| Goal       | The goal of this project is to provide anglers to log the fish they catch and capture species, size, location and weather data for the time the fish was caught and display this in a easy to see format. Data will be able to be filtered by weather data do help anglers understand how weather impacts their fishing. There will also be a personal best board where users can see the biggest fish of each species they have caught. |

| Users      | The primary user would be someone who fishes and wants to improve |

| Data       | Data will be broken down by users, fish catches, lakes, and fish species. The primary data that will be collected is weather data using the Open Weather api from www.openweathermap.org (temperature, pressure, and weather condition) as well as length, weight, and species of fish. Lake data will be collected or prepopulated and have lake name and nearest town so weather data can be collected |

# Breaking down your project

When planning your project, break down your project into smaller tasks, knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later. Some common tasks might include:

- Determining the database schema
- Sourcing your data
- Determining user flow(s)
- Setting up the backend and database
- Setting up the frontend
- What functionality will your app include?
  - User login and sign up
  - Uploading a user profile picture

Here are a few examples to get you started with. During the proposal stage, you just need to create the tasks. Description and details can be edited at a later time. In addition, more tasks can be added in at a later time.

| Task Name                   | Description                                                                                                   | Example                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design Database schema      | Determine the models and database schema required for your project.                                           | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/1) |
| Source Your Data            | Determine where your data will come from. You may choose to use an existing API or create your own.           | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/2) |
| User Flows                  | Determine user flow(s) - think about what you want a user’s experience to be like as they navigate your site. | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/3) |
| Set up backend and database | Configure the environmental variables on your framework of choice for development and set up database.        | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/4) |
| Set up frontend             | Set up frontend framework of choice and link it to the backend with a simple API call for example.            | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/5) |
| User Authentication         | Fullstack feature - ability to authenticate (login and sign up) as a user                                     | [Link](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues/6) |

## Labeling

Labeling is a great way to separate out your tasks and to track progress. Here’s an [example](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues) of a list of issues that have labels associated.

| Label Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Difficulty    | Estimating the difficulty level will be helpful to determine if the project is unique and ready to be showcased as part of your portfolio - having a mix of task difficultlies will be essential.                                                                                                                               | Easy, Medium, Hard           |
| Type          | If a frontend/backend task is large at scale (for example: more than 100 additional lines or changes), it might be a good idea to separate these tasks out into their own individual task. If a feature is smaller at scale (not more than 10 files changed), labeling it as fullstack would be suitable to review all at once. | Frontend, Backend, Fullstack |
| Stretch Goals | You can also label certain tasks as stretch goals - as a nice to have, but not mandatory for completing this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Must Have, Stretch Goal      |
